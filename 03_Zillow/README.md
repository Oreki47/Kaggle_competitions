Around 10/2018.

Published for EC2 connection.
I have drained my current PC with roughly 100k enetries with 130+ features and I am counting on EC2 to be a good alternative.
Currently I'm still at the stage of figuring things out.

All original data were in data dir. Submission in submission dir.
I still have 10 days so I guess this will be fun.

EC2 worked out like a CHARM!

Alright Job Done :)


Spent some time and wrote a short summary:

When the results are out I will write another review of what I have missed and How I can improve in the future.

02/15/2018 Edit:

This is probaly the first competition that I actually grinded through, and I got top 7% out of this one, because I got lucky. In retrospect I do not deserve such a good result. I was unaware of a lot of things -- cross validation, overfitting, stacking, to name a few. Definitely I have litte idea of how each model works. Today if you ask me about xgboost, at least I understand what the model is actually learning, and why using hessian and so on. But sometimes you just get lucky.

This is also the first competition I started to think from the angle of building up a system, or a flow. How to layout each component, and how to decouple functions so that when I want to make some changes to one, it would affect another in the minimal way. Of course I did not do well, but this competition gave me a lot of boost in confidence and makes me less anxious about my life. Back then (around 10/2018) I started to think about applying for internship and I found out that I knows basically nothing. I was constantly on the edge of falling apart. I even spent $6,000 on a 4-month workshop, trying to get myself ready. I will probably write a blog about this later on. Speaking about blog, it is also the reason I am cleaning up my repos today. Anyway, this competition opened a door for me.

I still haven't get to the review part, as this competition is not yet finished (my part is) for the winners. I am still waiting for the winning solutions.
