Around July 2017

I still remember last July, as I was busy participating trainings with my church. I spent roughly a week for this competition. The second challenge I met there was the relational database. I am more or less comfortable with JOIN of multiple spreadsheet now, but back then it was a diaster. I do not even know what people are doing. And I barely managed to get the input and output correct. I remember the interview from runner-up as he created an insanely amount of features. This is just business sense, or touch. I am getting some touch today, and hopefully will be getting more in the near future.
