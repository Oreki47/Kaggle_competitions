# 04 Safe Driver Prediction

10/2018 - 11/2018

On 02/15/2018:

I dived in right after finishing the Zillow. Now that I see it, it is probably not a good idea. That being said, I still learnt a lot. One of the most important things I learnt during this competitions: solid cv strategy rocks! I do not have time to check my codes thoroughly tonight. I will probably write a blog when I set up the Github pages (probably).

Another thing is that I know a bit more about how to have the training flow going. Of course I could run a notebook and let it run automatically. However, from my perspective, this is not the right way to do things. Notebooks are good for ad hoc analysis, not good for systematic experiments. I want to build up a running flow that would be benefitial to playing some specific competitions, but also coding in general. I am not sure if I am correct on this matter, but this is my way of doing it. And I will keep writing in this way.

As for the result, I did poorly, finishing aroung 20%. A huge mistake I made was I focused too much on the performance of individual feature, which should be the work of some scripts. Anyway, I learnt that I need to look at the big picture. This is properly covered in the next competition.
