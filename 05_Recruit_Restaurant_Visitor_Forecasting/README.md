I spent like 20 days on this one. And I got something like 80%. Epic fail but I am not that upset. I finally captured the running flow that works for me this time. I put several modes in a .bat file and run it throughout the night, and I check the results in the morning, set up a few more things. Also I think I layout most of the components correctly this time, with the only expection of the data preparation part. This competition also provided several spreadsheets from a relational database. This time, everything is just so obvious and I manage to build up the dataframe so beautifully (lol). I think I have got most of my component this time.

In the 4th competition, I wrote several classes including basic cross validation, forward/backward feature selection based on some basic logic. It helped me understand how these processes and now when I am using classes from sklearn I know how it behave (mostly), and can use them without wondering about what I am actually doing. This competition I spent like the first week figuring out different types of cross validation strategies (although none of them worked). Nothing worked. But my efforts are not in vain. I feel like with another 1 or 2 competition I would be able finishing developing a workflow that works for me, not just for the competition, but also for research and so on.

What I did not do in this and the previous competition is forking other people's idea from Kaggle kernel, i.e., I was poking around all by my self. This is definitely not a good strategy since I might learn a lot from other people in the process, and they may capture things I missed (or I have absolutely no idea of). Anyway, I am not rushing into my next competition, as I need to focus a bit more on research now. 

Also I still have not checked the winner solutions!
