Around April 2017

I joined Kaggle roughly 8 months ago, around April 2017. Back then I wasn't sure where I am heading to. I was struggling to get my first Journal published (failed, of course). And back then I was just a newbie. I still remember I started with this "playground" competition by reading some walkthroughs on a blog. Back then I have literally no idea how everything works. It has just been 8 months.
